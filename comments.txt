in the walk project, if.pdf, ex01 is unclear on what the secret word should be.
I was confused if we were supposed to use a word bank or create a 26 5 letter word bank.
If it's the latter, it would be a terrible game since it'll almost be impossible to solve.
I think ex01 needs to put in clues for the words.
